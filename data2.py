If operating TKPH\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActions required: The payload monitoring system has already been\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstalled in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspeed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProductivity and Health Monitoring System.

In a big mine, regular checking of tyre\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlot of time and manpower resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttransfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tused in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapplication may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuser.

This will help in optimum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tutilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunnecessary downtime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTyre Performance Analysis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecords to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfailures including premature failures, if any.

One of the major reasons for disability among the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tolder adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall.

Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tolder adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfalling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teveryday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore susceptible to future falls.

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinsight into the stability and security of the software. The process of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfuzzing can be divided into following broad steps –\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Identification of Target Function(s) – Target function(s) are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttypically those functions that act as entry points for processing input\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Developing harness – Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpurpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tharness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe target application receives and processes the input.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcertain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstate of the crash to file for later analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDescription:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrucial.

One common issue is the mismatch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnetwork design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a) to know the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrect Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toperations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcategories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneed to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat all times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDescription: Postal services are essential for various government,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfinancial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand rural areas.
