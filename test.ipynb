Thus, they need not be subject to the same processing requirements. The concept of Case Flow Management for High Court and Subordinate Courts was first introduced through the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, following which the Model Draft Rules were proposed by the Law Commission, Jagannadha Rao Committee, wherein model case management rules endorsed by the Supreme Court also containing timelines for different case types, the upper limit of which is two years were proposed.   Problem Statement/Challenge: Computerization has failed to improve the case scheduling process. However, solving some administrative problems through the aid of technology could reduce the constraints under which judges work and ensure the timely listing of cases thus aiding the speedy disposal of cases. A 'Differentiated Case Flow Management(DCM) system would enable a court to prioritize cases and the recognition that many cases can and should proceed through the court system at a faster pace than others if appropriate pathways are provided.   Objective/Expected Outcome: Under a DCM system, cases do not wait for disposition simply on the basis of the chronological order of their filing. This would greatly aid in minimizing and making more predictable the time between case events more and aid efficient disposal of cases.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Law and Justice \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware \\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nMiscellaneous\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Software ', 'SIH1279', '208', 'Miscellaneous'] ,\n",

Many legal service providers, such as advocates, arbitrators,  mediators, notaries, and document writers, operate independently and do not have a centralized  platform to offer their services to clients. This leads to a lack of transparency, difficulty in  finding the right legal service provider, and high costs for clients.  Objective: The objective of this hackathon is to develop an incentivized design to onboard legal  service providers on an eMarketplace to extend legal services to citizens in India.  Solution: Participants are expected to design a platform that can onboard legal service providers  on an eMarketplace and incentivize them to offer their services to clients. The platform should  be user-friendly, secure, and transparent, and should address the following challenges: 1. How to incentivize legal service providers to offer their services on the platform? 2. How to ensure transparency and accountability in the services provided by legal service  providers?  3. How to ensure the quality of legal services provided by the service providers? 4. How to ensure that clients can easily find the right legal service provider for their specific  legal needs?  5. How to ensure that the platform is accessible to citizens from all socio-economic  backgrounds?  Participants can consider various models for incentivizing legal service providers, such as  offering them bonuses, rewards, or other forms of recognition for their services. They can also  consider gamification techniques to motivate providers to offer quality services and compete  with each other on the platform.

The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited  freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted. The impact of it depends on where the  water is taken from and when if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the    consequences can be significant and require action. The increase in the amount of non-  available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water    footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased water  footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in  water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency,  this can be done if we have readily available data on water footprints. Hence by using digital  technologies like AI, Big Data, Blockchain, etc, and computer languages, a user-friendly app or  website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final  products we use in daily life by feeding little inputs or just by scanning through the camera like  Google lens. The app should support local languages, this will ensure pan-India usage and  sensitize the people about the water footprints of items they use in daily life.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Jal Shakti \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware \\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nClean & Green Technology\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Software ', 'SIH1287', '225', 'Clean & Green Technology'] ,\n",

One of the major challenges facing is the  high level of water loss in distribution networks. Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is defined as the  difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of  water recovered from consumers. NRW is a good indicator of water utility performance; In  addition, available NRW data are often found problematic, suspicious, inaccurate, or provide  only partial information. Hence, there is a need to develop a system or technology to trace and  tackle non-revenue water and convert it into revenue water using digital methods.

Central Water Commission (CWC) issues flood warnings in all flood-prone districts based on the regularly measured water gauge level. Flood warnings are issued by CWC to the state administration, whenever the gauge levels cross the danger mark. In all such cases, the severity of the problem is essentially indicated in terms of flood levels. However, the major concern of the state administration is regarding the difficulty faced in assessing the spatial extent of flooding for mapping rescue and relief works. Large volumes of imagery corresponding to varied flood inundations are expected to be available with NRSA and other freely assessable sources. The past imageries corresponding to a specific forecast site can be collected and each imagery be stamped with the observed water level of that particular date and time. An AI-ML-based GIS application can be developed to process the available imageries for projecting new imageries using suitable interpolation/extrapolation of 2D information corresponding to specific flood levels within a given range. The participants of SIH are expected to develop the above-mentioned application using open-source software and demonstrate its utility for any one of the CWC’s forecast sites (List will be shared) with readily available imageries. Participants can also seek to add value by incorporating tools for making critical infrastructure, filtering outliers, pointing out accuracy levels of projected inundation, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Jal Shakti \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware \\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nDisaster Management\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'Software ', 'SIH1289', '93', 'Disaster Management'] ,\n",

However, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation. This problem is particularly pronounced in piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops.  The core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. The inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronize irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts.  To address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks. By incorporating AI-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.  Key Challenges:  Dynamic Water Demand: Crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. Developing an AI system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge.  Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralized AI system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms.  Algorithm Precision: Designing AI algorithms that can effectively analyze soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities.  Valve Control Mechanism: Developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the AI's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network.  Adaptability: Ensuring that the AI system can adapt to changing environmental conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time.  User-Friendly Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the AI's autonomous decisions.  Economic Viability: Balancing the potential costs of implementing an AI-driven system with the expected benefits in terms of increased crop yield, water savings, and operational efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Jal Shakti \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nHardware\\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nAgriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Hardware', 'SIH1293', '500', 'Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development'] ,\n",

The challenge lies in accurately estimating the inflow to a reservoir, taking into account various factors such as rainfall, soil moisture conditions within the reservoir's catchment area, and upstream reservoir releases. The subsequent task of managing reservoir gates to release water in a controlled manner to prevent flooding adds another layer of complexity.   The existing methodologies for reservoir management often rely on manual intervention or simplistic models that may not capture the intricacies of changing environmental conditions. As a result, basins are vulnerable to both overflows and insufficient water supply during critical periods. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for an innovative solution that integrates data-driven approaches and automation to optimize reservoir gate operations and mitigate flood risks.     Key Challenges:   Accurate Inflow Estimation: Developing a robust and accurate method to estimate the inflow to a reservoir by considering multiple parameters, including rainfall intensity, soil moisture conditions within the catchment area, and potential contributions from upstream reservoir releases.   Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time data from weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors, and upstream reservoir releases into a centralized system for inflow estimation and decision-making.   Model Complexity: Designing sophisticated models that can effectively capture the complex interactions between rainfall, soil moisture, reservoir levels, and inflow dynamics, while remaining computationally feasible.   Optimal Gate Control: Developing an automated gate control mechanism that can regulate the release of water from the reservoir in a manner that prevents flooding downstream while ensuring optimal utilization of the stored water.   Flood Risk Assessment: Incorporating flood risk assessment models that consider downstream vulnerability, historical flood patterns, and potential impacts of various release strategies.   Adaptive Decision-Making: Creating algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions, such as sudden heavy rainfall events or unexpected reservoir releases from upstream, to make timely and accurate decisions.   Communication and Coordination: Ensuring effective communication and coordination among various stakeholders, including reservoir managers, weather forecast providers, and upstream reservoir operators.   Balancing Water Needs: Striking a balance between releasing enough water to prevent flooding while also maintaining a sufficient reservoir volume for future water supply and downstream water needs.   The proposed solution seeks to tackle these challenges by employing advanced data analytics, machine learning, and automation technologies. By creating an integrated system that leverages real-time data and predictive models, the solution aims to optimize reservoir gate operations to prevent flooding while optimizing water utilization.

From the survey, it has been observed that there is a demand from the lower limb amputee population regarding the use of motorbikes for transport purposes. However, for lower limb amputees, this operation creates some inconvenience as there is no active ankle movement. Most importantly, the prosthetic feet currently used in the Indian context possess stationery ankles, and in some cases, more advanced feet use hydraulics or external-powered systems which don't solve the practical requirements of riding motorbikes for this patient population. The main functions when riding a motorcycle is gear selection and brake operation using the amputated leg. The right foot applies the rear brake on the right side of the motorbike. This is normally operated with ankle movements to press down the foot on the brake lever. Considering the inconveniences being caused to the lower limb amputees, there is a requirement for some modification options such as utilizing a modified brake lever. Alternatively, the left side of the bike has a gear selector to accentuate the controlled speed. This is usually activated by left ankle movements to move the forefoot up and down depending on whether the gears need to go up or down. The modification for the lower limb amputees may include the left-hand thumb operated up and down gear selection to module the operation of active ankle prosthesis in either direction for forefoot up and down motions at 5-10 degrees intervals to engage and disengage the gear module. Development of brake operation will be useful to resolve the practical issues of riding motorbikes in lower limb amputees, the dream of which was once upon a time lost due to the lower limb amputation\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Social Justice and Empowerment \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nHardware\\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nMedTech / BioTech / HealthTech\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Hardware', 'SIH1306', '105', 'MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech'] ,\n",

So, such software should be made and propagated among fire personnel for its more efficient and convenient use for different eases and zones for different types of storage i.e different threat zones for different types of storage like LPG bullets, Horton spheres storing the same volume of LPG with different wind speed and wind directions will have different affected areas under radiations.\\n\\nDevelopment of such software will help a lot to our fire services to tackle any type of explosion and fire scenarios with more efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nMinistry of Home Affairs \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware \\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nDisaster Management\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Software ', 'SIH1308', '108', 'Disaster Management'] ,\n",

Enhancing\\nvocational training and employment prospects for people with disabilities is essential and there\\nare efforts happening at the National level that has to end up in employment that fetches significant\\neconomic benefits and dignified life for them.

The Intervention approaches must focus on one or\\na combination of both skills.\\n\\nHindi, the national language of India is spoken by over 1 million people, and 43% of the\\nIndian population. Though several training resources are available in English, the resources in\\nIndian languages are limited. A training resource manual titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Phonics and phonological\\nprocessing to Develop Literacy and Articulation-Preliteracy and Articulation drill bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\\ncontains the sounds of Hindi in isolation and in different words across all word positions. The\\nsame can be used to develop software for training individuals in perception and production\\nintervention. Given that the majority of the Indian population is in the rural regions and\\nhuman resources are in the urban regions, this software can help bridge the gap and serve the\\nun-served population. The software can be used to give visual and auditory stimulation and\\nfeedback and can help track progress. The training can be more intense with short frequent\\nsessions, and flexible timings.\\n\\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Detailed description:\\nMotor-based Intervention generally includes perceptual and production training and both can\\nbe incorporated into the same software.\\nPerceptual training also called ear training involves teaching their clients to perceive the\\ndistinction between the target and error sounds. Through software, the child can be presented\\nwith a variety of correct and incorrect real-speech examples of the target phoneme and can be\\nasked to make judgments about whether the production was correct. The software can also\\nprovide visual feedback about the accuracy of the childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s judgment. The software can also\\ntrack the childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s success rate to assist the clinician in monitoring progress.\\nProduction of a target sound can be done using imitation, phonetic placement, successive\\napproximation (shaping), and contextual utilization. All of these can be achieved using the\\nsoftware specifically developed for its use.\\nFor eg:\\nImitation: Several auditory models of the sound in isolation, syllables, or words can be\\nprovided. The child can be asked to watch and listen to the video that shows the 3-\\n\\ndimensional image of the sound /word being produced and then can be asked to repeat the\\nsame. The clientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production can also be recorded for self-feedback.\\nPhonetic Placement\\nWhen the client is unable to imitate a target sound, cues or instructions regarding where to\\nplace his or her articulators can be provided. Use of camera to serve as a mirror, images\\nshowing the placement, and videos showing the placement and movement during articulation\\ncan be developed. The videos would be 3 dimensional and could involve sound in isolation\\nand word level.\\n\\nContextual utilization\\nInvolves isolating a target sound from a particular phonetic context in which a client may\\nhappen to produce a sound correctly, even though he or she typically produces the sound in\\nerror. Eg: The child can say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bright sunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but cannot produceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in other context. Slowly\\nintroduce other context through the software and then progress to production ofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in\\nisolation.\\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Description of the Solution:\\nFor instance, the child needs to be taught the pronunciation of the syllable /ka/.\\n1. The word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“catÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is projected along with the picture.\\n2. As we tap the word, /kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦t/ is heard. This forms the auditory cue.\\n3. The placement of the tongue in the oral cavity and as its changes when the syllables /ka/\\n/ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦/ and /t/ are pronounced is presented on the animation. This provides a visual cue.\\n4. Production of Isolated syllables eg. /ka/ in this case, can also be shown.\\n5. The tongue movements inside the oral cavity can be shown in slow motion as well.\\nA total of 2-13 such words for each phoneme(depending on the frequency of occurrence of\\nphoneme in the language) , with each word having a maximum of 5 syllables can be shown to\\nexplain the articulatory pattern.

Additionally, skin disorders pose a significant threat to patients' well-being, mental health, ability to function, and social participation. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource-poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. Moreover, there is also a scarcity of physicians with dermatological training.

With the rise of transcriptional and translational facilities, several traditional medicinal texts are now available in their digitized forms. But for an Ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their \"\"drug of choice\\' often becomes tedious and impractical. Here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. For example, the two formulations Punarnavadi Kashaya and Vyaghryadi Kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows:  Both these are decoctions advised in Jvara (fever) and Kasa (cough). But in a patient with upper respiratory tract infections like common cold (Pinasa), Vyaghryadi would suit better than Punarnavadi. Whereas in a condition associated with inflammatory changes all over the body. I Punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. The objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. Certain ingredients (eg. jaggery) are unsuitable for certain categories of patients (e.g. diabetics). There are also medicine mediums that are unsuitable for specific diseases (e.g. fermented/alcoholic preparations in diabetes). Such information is also expected to be conveyed to the learner or practitioner who uses the software.  The same disease has been mentioned in different names (E.g. Jvara and Santapa for fever) and the same word has been used to denote different (Eg. Abhaya generally means Terminalia chebula but in the context of Jatyadi ghrita, it means Vetiveria zizanioides. The multiple names of same diseases are expected to be included in the tags of each formulation. The sources for the formulations, and synonyms and similar words have been included in the data section.

Developing infrastructure for each sector is a huge task and involves huge costs. Currently, a few tools are being used to monitor the day-to-day progress of the infrastructure, but they are all manual. This results in additional costs and the untimely completion of the infrastructural projects; thus, it affects the overall development of any sector. For further clarification, consider the infrastructure development associated with the education sector. If any government wants to set up a technical institute, it has to go through multiple processes, and one of the major processes is the timely establishment of the institute. With geo-tagging, it is possible to identify the chunk of land within the given location, district, town, etc., but the major challenge lies when it comes to the development of infrastructure. Currently, there is no mechanism available to monitor the progress on a real-time basis, so lots of manual intervention happens to monitor the progress. To overcome this issue, it is necessary to develop GIS and Al-based solutions through which real-time monitoring of the infrastructure can be done. Further, an application can also be developed that can work in both online and offline mode and through which day-to-day progress can be fed into the system.

An accommodating campus supports idea exchange, personal growth, and soft skill development. The safety of students, especially women's students, is a pillar of an accommodating campus. In the present scenario, the measures available to college administrators and students, such as the installation of CCTV cameras, increased security on campuses, and the establishment of police outposts, are reactive in nature, i.e., they are pressed into action only after the occurrence of a mishap. The objective of the problem statement is to develop predictive analytic models to prevent mishaps even before they occur. The second issue pertaining to women's safety is the lack of manpower for proactive interventions to prevent mishaps. Another objective is to develop, monitor, predict, and provide actionable intelligence for the prevention of mishaps. The solution can explore the contours of anonymous and non-anonymous data collection mechanisms, point-to-point reporting systems, and predictive data analytics for providing actionable intelligence. Further, the collected data can be leveraged to develop and mark probable black spots and red time zones for pin-pointed actions to be taken by administrators.\\nTo promote a community-based system, the system may be designed in such a way that it not only gathers information from students but also involves the entire student community in the prevention of mishaps.\\nThe data collected from the participants can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring can be done with an interactive dashboard and charts. It can also be used to develop real-time rapid intervention by the student community, college administration, and local authorities.\\nFurther to this, a companion model can also be developed for students that helps them travel through black spots and during red time zones. This will not only ensure the community participation of students but also develop a responsibility-sharing framework for campus safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nGovernment of Jharkhand \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware \\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nMiscellaneous\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Software ', 'SIH1371', '205', 'Miscellaneous'] ,\n",

When education is done right, it not only teaches people about the science of climate change and inequality and the reasons we must take action, it also engages, empowers and promotes a more environmentally friendly, community-based way of life. ESG in higher education is one of least discussed aspects of governance among administrators. With the recent energy and climate crisis, administrators around the globe have realized the importance of sustainable process. The three pillars of ESG are people, processes, and product.\\nIn our case, people are the most important stakeholder in achieving our goal. Students from campuses of Higher Education are not only woke about the climate-energy crises but also are passionate for deigning a world of their future. Administrators on other hand are aware of the rising cost of energy and are open to adopting energy conservation and other aspects of ESG\\nThe objective of the problem statement solution shall be to create a common platform for planning, development, execution, and monitoring of ESG initiative. The initiatives may include adopting alternative sources of energy, development of energy efficient campuses, adopting green construction standards like GRIHA Prakriti and similar such initiatives. Another objective of the problem statement solution is to generate and produce dynamic dashboards which show targeted lacking areas as well as progress check for currently undertaken projects. The overall objective of the solution should be based on a collaborative effort between all the stakeholder for creating ESG framework in Higher Education. If executed effectively the solution will not only make a significance difference to the present scenario but also create a generation of environmentally and socially aware citizens with in depth knowledge on ESG issues.\\nThe solution should be in line with India's ambition of achieving its targets under COP 21 of Paris Agreement. It should also incorporate the best practice steps taken by governments like the International Solar Alliance.

ACC is an option for nonverbal mode of communication for the persons with communication deficit. This mode is especially used by non verbal individuals. \\nThose who are having multiple disability and communication deficit, they must have to communicate with others but due to lack to motor coordination, intellectual deficit and sensory perceptual deficit not able to communicate with others. This is the major problem related of communication for the multiple disability or mainly those were having maximum deficit in motor coordination for communication, Due to communication deficit peoples are not able to communicate with the society. \\nHITECH AAC is available in India which is developed in Foreign Countries that is very costly. There is need to develop an electronically low cost AAC and hardware made in Indian context. If AAC electronic device and hardware mode will be develop in Indian context, it will be easy and helpful for persons with nonverbal communication deficit.

To streamline our processes and improve efficiency, we aim to develop a system capable of extracting and standardizing these documents at a provider level. Additionally, we need to identify claims across different providers that exhibit similar document templates.\\n\\nThe primary issue we face stems from fraudulent customers who exploit identical digital or printed templates, with minor modifications such as changing the provider names, logos, colors, and text content positioning. By manipulating the customer details within these templates, they attempt to file reimbursement claims that are difficult to detect using standard document comparison checks.\\n\\nTo tackle this problem, we require the development of a robust Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm. This algorithm will automate the process of template extraction and standardization, allowing us to identify similarities and patterns across various documents. By comparing the templates used in different claims, we can effectively identify instances of potential fraud, even when the textual content has been altered.\\n\\nThe algorithm should be designed to handle a high volume of documents from diverse providers and customers. It should be capable of identifying commonalities in template structure, design elements, and formatting, while also accounting for variations resulting from legitimate differences between providers. Key objectives of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm: \\n\\n1. Template Extraction: Develop a mechanism to extract and standardize templates from medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from providers and customers. \\n2. Template Comparison: Implement an algorithm to compare and identify similarities among different document templates, accounting for minor modifications and variations in content. \\n3. Fraud Detection: Enhance the algorithm to flag instances of potentially fraudulent claims where similar templates are used, with modifications made to customer details while maintaining the overall structure and design. \\n4. Scalability and Efficiency: Ensure the algorithm can handle a large volume of documents efficiently, considering the growing number of providers and customers we deal with. \\n5. Flexibility: Design the algorithm to accommodate variations in template design and content across different providers, while maintaining the ability to detect fraudulent patterns\\n\\nThe successful development and implementation of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will significantly enhance our ability to detect fraudulent claims and improve the overall accuracy and efficiency of our document processing workflows. \\n\\nTheme: Fraud Detection & Document Templatization \\n\\nEvaluation Criteria: The effectiveness of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will be evaluated based on several key criteria. The primary criterion is the accuracy of detection, which measures the algorithm's ability to identify similarities in document templates accurately and efficiently. The algorithm should be able to detect instances where fraudulent customers exploit identical templates with minor modifications, distinguishing between suspicious and fraudulent documents. \\n\\nTo aid in the interpretation and communication of the algorithm's findings, the detected output should be represented using color-coded flags. Amber flags can be used to indicate suspicious documents that exhibit similarities in template structure or design elements, while red flags should be assigned to identify documents with high potential for fraud. This visual representation will assist investigators in prioritizing their efforts and taking appropriate actions. \\n\\nInput Data Set: The team will have to generate their own dataset using publicly \\navailable datasets or archives. This approach ensures that the algorithm is exposed to a wide range of document templates from various providers and customers. The dataset should encompass different document types, such as medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports, reflecting the real-world scenarios the algorithm will encounter during deployment. \\n\\nBy using this self-generated dataset, the algorithm can be trained and evaluated under realistic conditions. This approach enables the algorithm to learn patterns and similarities that exist in actual documents, allowing it to accurately detect fraudulent claims and identify suspicious patterns across different providers and customers. \\n\\nTeams working on this problem statement are advised to create their own dataset to build and train their algorithms.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganization\\nBajaj Finserv Health Ltd. \\n\\n\\nCategory\\nSoftware\\n\\n\\nDomain Bucket\\nMiscellaneous\\n\\n\\nYoutube Link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDataset Link\\n\\n                                                               NA\\n                                                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Software', 'SIH1441', '122', 'Miscellaneous'] ,\n",

For instance, the healthcare sector needs HAR to monitor the activities of patients, the elderly, or people with specific needs. By doing so, \\nit can offer prompt services and make decisions in real-time according to the requirements. Similarly, the sports industry also utilizes HAR to track a player's performance by monitoring their movements, identifying and comparing the actions performed, and conducting automatic statistical analysis. Consequently, it is essential to implement such workflows quickly and more efficiently based on specific\\ndomain requirements. An effective solution is to consider various sensor data from mobile phones, such as accelerometers and GPS, and analyze such short-duration time series data. The analysis may aim at estimating the activity, distance traveled, steps taken, calories burned, and altitude climbed, among others.\\n\\nThe solution is expected in the form of Android/iOS app that is developed using Simulink (with the help of Android/iOS support packages).\\n\\nReferences links below:\\n1.
